# Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain (for PortMaster)

**Unofficial Native Port for R36S, ArkOS, and Retro Handhelds.**

This is a native ARM64 build of *Celeste 64*, originally created by Maddy Makes Games for the 6th anniversary of Celeste. This port was recompiled using **NativeAOT** to run flawlessly on low-power devices like the R36S, avoiding the stuttering issues of Mono.
